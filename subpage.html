		<h3>sarah</h3>
		<p>Sarah hails from home of the world renowned Guiness Jazz festival (what a combo!) in Co. Cork, Ireland. Moving to the bright lights of London two years ago, she spends her days working in the world of fashion and her nights as one third of the Bad Girls in Bad Girls Groove . Coming from a background of mostly soul and Motown singing, she has also done her time on an Irish reality tv show not too dissimilar to the XFactor as part of a girl group.  So Sarah’s not at all fazed by the diva-style behaviour of the Bad Girls (and boys)...</p>

		<h3>roger</h3>
		<p>"Well I stepped out of a mirror at ten years old
With a suit cut sharp, as a razor and a heart of gold
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
I'm gonna play that thing until the day I die"

I can't really say it better than John Hiatt......although I don't think I have ever played in a suit, and I don't think I ever will. I have however played my guitar in England, Greece, Spain, Australia, Portugal and Ireland and i'm happy to play with the Bad Girls anywhere. This is by far the funkiest band I have ever been in. Let's do it</p>

		<h3>jason</h3>
		<p>Jason took up the drums purely to spurn his parents who were adamant that he should become a classical pianist from a young age. Many years on, the protest continues as he stubbornly tours the world as a professional drummer.</p>

		<h3>trimmer</h3>
		<p>Trimmer’s formal music education is a BA in Jazz Studies and an MA
in Electro - Acoustic Composition.

Trimmer’s first band Burlesque were signed to Arista Records in 1976, and produced two albums ‘Acupuncture’ and ‘Burlesque’. Their musical style could be loosely described as a hybrid of Miles Davis meets Frank Zappa, with European art house perspectives and English eccentricity. Composing more than one hundred and fifty pieces for the group and giving nine hundred performances throughout Europe and the U.K. 
In 1979 with musical partner, guitarist Billy Jenkins they performed as Trimmer & Jenkins, - free jazz and jokes - recording an album and two singles for Charisma Records, and giving five hundred performances.
In 1983 he started performing and recording in with drummer, Ginger Baker, composing music for live shows including Glastonbury as well as recording – ‘Ginger Baker’s Nutters’. At the same Trimmer also worked as a session player in London, recording and touring for English rock acts such as Toyah, One the Juggler, The Fabulous Poodles, and punk jazz with Billy Jenkins and The Voice of God Collective among others.
By 1988 a decision to stop touring and concentrate on more compositional work in London, writing original music for the moving image, working on television commercials and documentaries, exploring the sound worlds of twelfth to twentieth century classical, electronic and ethnic music, from a postmodernist perspective. 
Since 1993 Trimmer has been working and recording with Mary Masselos, the Australian violinist and music therapist, and since then has arranged and produced ten albums of music for her.
With a desire to perform again, in 1995 Trimmer assembled a group of London musicians under the title of ‘The Jazz Angels’ to play Jazz and Latin music, and after four hundred performances are still together in 2013.</p>

		<h3>matteo</h3>
		<p>Matteo di Cugno started his career as a sound engineer in Italy in the sunny region of Puglia, the heel of the boot.
Since he moved to London in 2007 he got involved in many projects with passion and enthusiasm working for the Gun Factory Recording Studio, The Grove Music Studios and following bands in their journey; the most affluent being a session with Bat For Lashes in their preparation for the tour 2012.

Matteo had a taste of the business for a few months after secondary school and then decided to attend a sound engineer course in Bologna.
Once back with Mamma he found himself working for two of the local sound rental companies for 4 years where he worked his way through being the front of house engineer for many gigs, mostly jazz, soul and pop acts; he also engineered in those years several ballets, musicals and plays.
Still during those years in Italy he started following bands that eventually ended playing on nationwide festivals and as opening acts for top charting bands.
Whilst mixing live sounds he also developed a passion for production of new material: with a mobile Protools rig first, and later in a proper studio.

Matteo develops his career as in a journey endlessly seeking the ultimate quality; he gets deeply involved in every project . He also likes pizza and girls but not necessarily in that order....</p>
